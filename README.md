# Algorithm Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
This project compares the efficiency and scalability of Randomized Quicksort and Hash Table with Chaining.

## Files
- `quicksort.py`: Quicksort implementation.
- `Randomized_Quicksort.py`: Randomized Quicksort implementation.
- `report.pdf`: Theoretical and empirical analysis.
- `README.md`: Instructions to run the code and summary of findings.
- `Images`: Images attached for the Report

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository and run the python files `quicksort.py` and `Randomized_Quicksort.py`
